You are not allowed to add space, use underscores _ replace. You are not allowed to use special characters. You can not use any keywords used by bash.  For example, right variable names:\nRUNOOB LD_LIBRARY_PATH _var var2 Wrong variable names:\n?var=123 user*name=runoob Except assign a variable with =, a statement is also right. For example:\nfor file in `ls /etc` # or for file in $(ls /etc) Note that no spaces can be added to the sides of the equals sign.\n# right FOO=\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; echo $BAR # wrong BAR = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; echo $BAR Access Variable If you want to use a variable, add $ before the variable name:\nyour_name=\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34; echo $your_name echo ${your_name} The {} can be ignored, but still recommend you add it. That is because when you are faced with this situation:\nfor skill in Ada Coffee Action Java; do echo \u0026#34;I am good at ${skill}Script\u0026#34; done If you ignore the {}, the script will think you want to access a variable named skillScript, which will cause some problems.\nAll of the variables you defined can be redefined:\nyour_name=\u0026#34;Tom\u0026#34; echo $your_name your_name=\u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34; echo $your_name Write a script in this way are right but note that if you assign a variable the second time, do not use $ because the $ only be used when you want to access it.\nRead-only Variable Using thereadonly  command can make a variable read-only.\n#!/bin/bash  myUrl=\u0026#34;https://www.google.com\u0026#34; readonly myUrl myUrl=\u0026#34;https://aimerneige.com\u0026#34; If you run this script, you will get this error output:\n./test.sh: line 5: myUrl: readonly variable Delete Variable You can delete a variable with unset.\nunset variable_name Variable can not be accessed after being deleted. Note that unset can not delete a read-only variable.\nFor example:\n#!/bin/sh  myUrl=\u0026#34;https://aimerneige.com\u0026#34; unset myUrl echo $myUrl If you run this script, you will get noting for output.\nVariable Type  local variable: Define in a shell script, only available in the script. environment variable: Define in the system environment, can be accessed by all of the program and shell scripts. shell variable: Define in shell program, some of them are local variables and some of them are environment variables. These variables make sure the shell runs properly.  Shell String The string is the most used data structure. You can define a string with a single quote ', double quotes \u0026quot; or without quotation marks.\nsingle-quoted string str=\u0026#39;this is a string\u0026#39; Limitations of single-quoted strings:\n Any character in single quotes will be output as is, variables in single quoted strings are invalid; A single quote cannot appear in a single quote string (even after using an escape character for a single quote), but it can appear in pairs and be used as string concatenation.  Enclosing characters in single quotation marks (‘) holds onto the literal value of each character within the quotes. In simpler words, the shell will interpret the enclosed text within single quotes literally and will not interpolate anything including variables, backticks, certain \\ escapes, etc. No character in the single quote has special meaning. This is convenient when you do not want to use the escape characters to change the way the bash interprets the input string.double-quoted string Example:\nyour_name=\u0026#34;runoob\u0026#34; str=\u0026#34;Hello, I know you are \\\u0026#34;$your_name\\\u0026#34;! \\n\u0026#34; echo -e $str Example output:\nHello, I know you are \u0026#34;runoob\u0026#34;! Advantage of double-quoted string:\n Variables can be enclosed in double quotes Escape characters can appear in double quotes  Double quotes are similar to single quotes except that it allows the shell to interpret dollar sign ($), backtick(`), backslash() and exclamation mark(!). The characters have special meaning when used with double quotes, and before display, they are evaluated. A double quote may be used within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash.\nstring concatenation Example:\nyour_name=\u0026#34;runoob\u0026#34; # double-quoted string greeting=\u0026#34;hello, \u0026#34;$your_name\u0026#34; !\u0026#34; greeting_1=\u0026#34;hello, ${your_name}!\u0026#34; echo $greeting $greeting_1 # single-quoted string greeting_2=\u0026#39;hello, \u0026#39;$your_name\u0026#39; !\u0026#39; greeting_3=\u0026#39;hello, ${your_name} !\u0026#39; echo $greeting_2 $greeting_3 Example output:\nhello, runoob ! hello, runoob ! hello, runoob ! hello, ${your_name} ! length of string string=\u0026#34;abcd\u0026#34; echo ${#string} # output: 4 If the variable are array, ${#string} is equivalent to ${#string[0]}.\nFor Example:\nstring=\u0026#34;abcd\u0026#34; echo ${#string[0]} # output: 4 extract substring Assume there is a variable var=http://www.aaa.com/123.htm.\n# operator, delete left characters, keep right characters echo ${var#*//} Where var is the variable name, the # sign is the operator, and *// means to delete the first //sign from the left and all characters on the left from the left.\nIn the example, delete http:// and we got www.aaa.com/123.htm.\n## operator, delete left characters, keep right characters echo ${var##*/} ##*/ means to delete the last (rightmost) / sign from the left and all characters to the left from it.\nIn the example, delete http://www.aaa.com/ and we got 123.htm\n% operator, delete right characters, keep left characters echo ${var%/*} %/* means to delete the first / sign from the right and the characters to the right from it.\nIn the example, delete /123.htm and we got http://www.aaa.com.\n%% operator, delete right characters, keep left characters echo ${var%%/*} %%/* means to delete the last (leftmost) / sign from the right and all characters to the right from it.\nIn the example, delete //www.aaa.com/123.htm and we got http:.\nfrom left index with character counts echo ${var:0:5} Where 0 means start from the first character from left, and 5 means the total number of characters.\nIn the example, we got http:.\nfrom left index to end echo ${var:7} The 7 means start from the 8th character from left and till the end.\nIn the example, we got www.aaa.com/123.htm.\nfrom right index with character counts echo ${var:0-7:3} Where 0-7 means start from the 7th character from right, and the 3 means the total number of characters.\nIn the example, we got 123.\nfrom left index to start echo ${var:0-7} The 0-7 means start from the 7th character from right and till the end.\nIn the example, we got 123.htm.\nNote: The index of the first character are 0.\nSearch String Find the position of the character i or o (whichever occurs first is counted)\nstring=\u0026#34;runoob is a great site\u0026#34; echo `expr index \u0026#34;$string\u0026#34; io` # output 4  More about expr command:\n https://cheat.sh/expr https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expr-command-in-linux-with-examples/   Shell Array You can use one-dimensional array in bash.

Take fedora system as an example, simply run this command:\nsudo dnf install hugo Create Site Directory Create your site directory with this command:\nhugo new site blog Change to work directory:\ncd blog Use git for version control:\ngit init Install Theme Pick up your favorite theme, clone it into ./themes directory directly.\ngit clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1  Use --depth=1 to ignore the commit history.\n Of course, you can download a zip file and unzip it.\nIf you wants to make version control more convenient and update more easily, use this command to add submodule:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod --depth=1 Clone submodules when reclone repo:\ngit submodule update --init --recursive Update theme:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge Config hugo support many config file format.
