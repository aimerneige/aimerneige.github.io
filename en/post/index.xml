      <description>After upgrade my ubuntu 20.04, I find the system ui resolution is small and looks ugly. I search google for this which tell me to reinstall my Graphics Card Driver. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, so I have to try it myself. And here are my solutions:
 Open the settings. Select the Displays. Change the scale bigger. Select revert. All done.  After the system reboot, this problem will appear again.</description>

      <description>https://leetcode.com/problems/pyramid-transition-matrix/
  We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.
We are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors A and B, if and only if ABC is an allowed triple.
We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed.</description>

      <title>Dark Mode on Android</title>

      <description>In this example, I am using Material Design. But you can also use the Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.
This is a simple way to adapt a dark mode, if you wants more, check for GitHub or Internet.
 Change the style First you should use the DayNight style by Google.
&amp;lt;style name=&amp;#34;AppTheme&amp;#34; parent=&amp;#34;Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight&amp;#34;&amp;gt; If you want to let things easily, that&amp;rsquo;s enough. But you can also provide more adaptation.
Adapt colors Make a new folder at project/app/src/main/res/values-night then make a new resource file colors.</description>

      <description>Welcome Welcome!
This is my first Blog and I am glad it works. Before then, I have tried many times to build a blog. But all of them failed. That made me really upset and there has been a long time before I try it again today.
I had meet many problems and I think I can make an article to help others likes me to build their own blog.</description>
